How to use it: 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
First you can see a main_server.py file which is server and a client_side.py file which is for clients or we can say your friends.

Second you have To execute main_server.py file in your terminal and on other terminal you have to execute client_side.py file so we can make a connect between both sides.

Third on main_server.py terminal you have to enter your machine ip address or local host and a port number (make sure you don't select port 80)

Fourth You have to go to your second terminal which is client_side.py, now you have to select your nickname and enter a same ip and port with which main_server.py is connected.

Boom !! you just build up a connection

Same you have to do open another terminal and then execute client_side.py and select your friends name and Booom!! Now both of you clients now can talk to each other and you can also add more and more friends by just telling them to execute client_side.py file in terminal and enter same ip and port as main_server.py.
